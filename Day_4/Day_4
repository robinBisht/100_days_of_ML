Started learning the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Sckikit learn, Tensorflow" (O-Rielly)

Today I studied the first chapter of this book and it provide me with the jargons of the machine learning

I learnt about different classes of Machine Learning: (Supervised,Unsupervised),(Model based,Instance based),(Batch Learning,Online Learning) etc.

Then it informed me about the various type of errors that can happen in the machine learing project because of various reasons:
data mismatch, overfitting and underfitting,etc.
